          <b>M.Sc. Sociotechnical Engineering - Uppsala University</b> A master
          of science in engineering at Uppsala University. The Sociotechnical
          Systems Engineering program is quite unique, as it is one of the few
          programs that combines IT and tech with social studies. My studies are
          focused a lot on the cross-section between humans and tech.
